# qrdecomposition_sourav
A package to perform the QR decomposition of a two dimensional matrix.

The package can be used as follows:

import qrdecomposition_sourav as qrs

inst = qrs(M)     # M is a numpy array or a list of ints or floats
                  # this instantiates a class with methods QR(), Qmatrix(), Rmatrix(), FloatingPointErrorOrder()
                  # use help(...) to view the docstring for the methods (and other functios defined)
