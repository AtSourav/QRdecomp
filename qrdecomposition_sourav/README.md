# QRdecomp
UU course on Python and scientific programming: project 

This is one of the projects suggested in the course: the task is to develop a package to perform the QR decomposition of a matrix using the orthogonal Householder transformation, and then make a pip package out of it with dependencies. And then "Add CI using Travis, testing installation from pip and running on a random matrix." (I'm not yet sure what "CI" and "Travis" are.)
